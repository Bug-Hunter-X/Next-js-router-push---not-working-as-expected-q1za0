# Next.js router.push() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Next.js `router.push()` method for client-side navigation. The navigation fails to update the browser URL and the page content remains unchanged.

## Bug Description

The `router.push()` method, used in `pages/about.js`, should redirect to the home page (`/`) when the button is clicked. However, it doesn't update the URL or the page content.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the "Go back to Home" button. Observe that the URL does not change and the page content stays the same.

## Solution

The issue is resolved by correctly using `router.push()` and ensuring that the correct path is specified. See the `bugSolution.js` file for the updated code.
